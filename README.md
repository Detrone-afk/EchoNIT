Intra: Derived from the Latin prefix meaning "within" or "inside," it signifies something internal or confined to a particular organization or group.
NIT: Refers to National Institute of Technology, specifically NIT Delhi in this case.


"IntraNIT" symbolizes a platform for internal communication and collaboration exclusively within NIT Delhi. It emphasizes connectivity and interaction among students, staff, and faculty members inside the institution.
IntraNIT is a robust and easy-to-use real-time messaging application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Itâ€™s designed to provide an efficient platform for communication, enabling users to send direct messages, share files, and engage in group discussions.
